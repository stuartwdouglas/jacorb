In this chapter  we explain how to obtain and  install JacORB, and give
an overview of the package contents.

\section{Downloading JacORB}


JacORB can be downloaded as a source or binary distribution in a
g-zipped tar--archive or zip--archive format from the JacORB home
page at \href{http://www.jacorb.org}{http://www.jacorb.org}.

To install JacORB, first unzip and untar (or simply unzip) the archive
somewhere.  This will result  in a new directory {\tt \JacORBDir}.
After this follow the instructions in {\tt \JacORBDir/doc/INSTALL}.

\section{Installation}
\label{Sec_installation}

\subsection{Requirements}

JacORB requires JDK 1.5 or above properly installed on your machine.  To build
JacORB (and compile the examples) you need to have the XML--based make tool
``Ant'' installed on your machine (version 1.7.1 or greater).  Ant can be downloaded
from \href{http://jakarta.apache.org/ant}{http://jakarta.apache.org/ant}. All make
files ({\tt build.xml}) are written for this tool.

To rebuild JacORB completely, just type {\tt ant} in the installation directory. Optionally,
you might want to do a {\tt ant realclean} first. It might be neccessary to set the following
environment variable prior to invoking Ant:
\small{
\begin{verbatim}
   export ANT_OPTS="-Xmx256m"
\end{verbatim}
}
For SSL, you need an implementation of the SSL protocol. We currently support
Oracle's JSSE Reference implementation included in the JDK.

\subsection{Libraries}
Once JacORB is installed, the bin directory should contain the scripts used to assist in
running JacORB applications (see \ref{runningExampleApp}) and \ref{appRunningEndorsed}).
The lib directory contains the JacORB libraries and third party libraries required by the ORB
and services (See below). JacORB libraries have been split as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item jacorb.jar          - containing the ORB, IMR, IR and NamingService
\item jacorb-services.jar - containing all other services (e.g. Notification, DDS, Collection etc).
\item idl.jar             - containing the IDL compiler.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dependencies}

JacORB depends upon the following third party software
\begin{enumerate}
\item Simple Logging Facade For Java (SLF4J Version 1.5.0)
\end{enumerate}

Note that the services may depend upon further third party libraries.
